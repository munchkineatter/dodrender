STEP 2: UPDATE VBA CODE WITH YOUR URL
-------------------------------------
1. Copy your Render URL (e.g., https://prize-display-xxxx.onrender.com)

2. Open the ExportGameState.bas file

3. Find this line near the top:
   Public Const RENDER_URL As String = "https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com"

4. Replace YOUR-APP-NAME with your actual Render URL

5. Add the module to your Excel workbook:
   - Open Excel, press Alt+F11
   - Right-click project > Insert > Module
   - Paste the updated code


STEP 3: UPDATE GAMEBOARD.CLS
----------------------------
Make sure your Gameboard.cls has this line after the prize strikethrough loop:

        ExportGameStateToJSON


STEP 4: TEST THE CONNECTION
---------------------------
1. In Excel, press Alt+F11 to open VBA Editor
2. Press Ctrl+G to open Immediate Window
3. Type: WakeUpServer
4. Press Enter
5. You should see "Server is awake and ready!"

6. Type: TestEliminatePrizes
7. Press Enter
8. Check your Render URL in a browser - 3 prizes should be crossed out!

9. Type: ResetGameDisplay
10. Press Enter to reset


STEP 5: OPEN THE DISPLAY
------------------------
On your second monitor, open a browser to your Render URL:
https://prize-display-xxxx.onrender.com

The display will update in real-time when you play the game!


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

1. FREE TIER SLEEP:
   - Render's free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
   - Run "WakeUpServer" from VBA before starting a game session

2. KEEP IT AWAKE DURING GAME:
   - The web browser viewing the display keeps it awake
   - Just make sure the browser tab is open before the game

3. INTERNET REQUIRED:
   - Both Excel PC and display browser need internet


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

"Server not responding":
- Server may be sleeping. Run WakeUpServer and wait 30 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the RENDER_URL in VBA is correct

"Error 404":
- Make sure all files were uploaded to GitHub correctly
- Check that Render deployed successfully

"Display not updating":
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify ExportGameStateToJSON is being called in your code
- Try TestEliminatePrizes to test the connection
